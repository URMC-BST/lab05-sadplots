## Deadline: 6 October 2021 10:59AM
[Instructions](https://urmc-bst.github.io/bst430-fall2021-site/hw_lab_instruction/lab05-sadplots/lab05-sadplots.html)

Note that in class on 6 October your group will give a short (3-5 minute) presentation on your 2 plots explaining what you did and why.  (Fine to just step through your markdown, no need to prepare slides.)

This repo contains starter documents and any supplementary files (e.g. datasets) that you need for this assignment.  Check your code for lint with `lint_assignment()`.
You can commit and push to this repo as many times as you want until the deadline stated above.
See course syllabus for policy on late submissions.
